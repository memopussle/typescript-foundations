TypeScript = JavaScript + A Type System

- 'type annotations' : comments to tell us how it works

### Why do we need type?
- Types are used by the TS Compiler to analyze our code for errors
- Types allow other engineers to understand what values are flowing around our codebase

### Where do we use types?
- Everywhere!

# Type Annotations and Inference
- Type annotations: Code we add to tell Typescript what type of value a variable will refer to
- Type inference: Typescript tries to figure out what type of value a variable refers to
